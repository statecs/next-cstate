# cstate.se

This is the source code for my website. 

The website features:

- Portfolio
- Editorial pages
- Dark mode

The website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses the new app directory.

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling, with [Tailwind Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) for better typography defaults.

[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is used for animations.

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) is used for content management. The content is fetched at build time and is statically generated.

[Vercel OG](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#examples) is used for generating Open Graph images for collections.
